# CharacterProve
Developed a machine learning and deep learning-based system for detecting AI-generated text, leveraging Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. The project
involved data manipulation and visualization, class balancing, and feature extraction using TF-IDF. Implemented a
neural network model using LSTM layers to classify human vs. AI-generated text with high accuracy. Visualized
patterns in text using word clouds and class distributions, ensuring reliable analysis.
