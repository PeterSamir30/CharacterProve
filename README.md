# CharacterProve -  AI-Generated Text Detection

#### Introduction
Developed a machine learning and deep learning-based system for detecting AI-generated text, leveraging Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. The project
involved data manipulation and visualization, class balancing, and feature extraction using TF-IDF. Implemented a
neural network model using LSTM layers to classify human vs. AI-generated text with high accuracy. Visualized
patterns in text using word clouds and class distributions, ensuring reliable analysis.

#### Datasets
The datasets for this project are a combination of multiple Kaggle datasets.

1 - [AI vs. Human Text](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text/data): This dataset contains around 500,000 essays, both created by AI and written by humans. 

2-  [Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jdragonxherrera/augmented-data-for-llm-detect-ai-generated-text?select=final_train.csv): this dataset contain two classes, AI and written by humans.

3 - [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/llm-detect-ai-generated-text-dataset/data): Dataset contains more than 28,000 essay written by student and AI generated. 

4 - [AI Generated Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset): This dataset contains around 300,000 essays, both created by AI and written by humans.
